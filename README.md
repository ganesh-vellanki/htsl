HTML to Excel a C# library


## A C# library for converting HTML To Excel

### Why this library? Purpose

Well, sometimes to create a good excel output/report, a developer should write a huge chunk of code to set each cell value, color..etc. 
that's not maintainable even for the person who wrote it. 

This library comes into play, by using HTML tables each table row will be a excel row, and each td will be an excel cell. And one can add styles to rows and cells too.
