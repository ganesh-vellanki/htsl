Purpose\r\n\r\nWell, sometimes to create a good excel output/report, a developer should write a huge chunk of code to set each cell value, color..etc. \r\nthat's not maintainable even for the person who wrote it. \r\n\r\nThis library comes into play, by using HTML tables each table row will be a excel row, and each td will be an excel cell. And one can add styles to rows and cells too.\r\n\r\n### Status of Project\r\n\r\nRight now it is in Beta, very much new. Any contributions to this project are welcome.\r\n\r\n### Documentation \r\n\r\nBuilding API is in progress, Docs & Samples will be available soon.\r\n\r\n### Nuget package\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/htslCore/\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
